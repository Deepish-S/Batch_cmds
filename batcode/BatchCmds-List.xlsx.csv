Data Types in Batch
Integers – Batch supports the whole set of positive and negative integers
Strings – Unlike most programming languages we rarely use (“”) double-quotes here but we use ‘echo‘ command to print strings
REM: Adds comments to a batch file.

Variables in Batch Scripting
To create variables we use the command “SET” command. 
"A variable, unlike many programming languages, can be assigned simply without specifying any data type to it."

EX : SET my_variable=Hello World

Arithmetic Operators in a Batch Script
List of operators :

SET /A sum=1+1     ::addition operator
ECHO %sum%     
SET /A mul=7*9     ::multiplication operator
ECHO %mul%
SET /A div=9/3     ::Division operator
ECHO %div%
SET /A assign=10   ::Assignment operator
ECHO %assign%
SET /A assign+=15  ::Increment then assignment operator
ECHO %assign%
SET /A mod= 10%3   ::Modulus/Remainder operator
ECHO %mod%

"DIR – The ‘dir’ command is used to get all the directories, sub-directories, and files present in the current working directory."
CD – The ‘cd’ command is used to change the current working directory.
VER – The ‘ver’ command tells the version of the user’s Windows.
CLS – The ‘cls’ command is used to clear the screen of the command prompt.
ECHO – The ‘echo’ command is by default ‘on’ but if we turn it off by ‘echo off’ it turns off prompt till the time ‘echo on’ is passed.
@ – The ‘@’ if used before any command hides which command is running.
@ECHO OFF – This commands serves as the start point to any basic batch script as it hides the prompt with ‘echo off’ and hides ‘echo off’ command with ‘@’.
HELP – This command tells us all about the commands available in the cmd. It runs only if the cmd is run as an administrator.
